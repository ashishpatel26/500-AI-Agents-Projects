## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS

### Modular Structure = Speed

**PROMPT.md**:
- Small (3-5KB)
- Fast load (30 sec)
- Common commands
- **Use daily**

**Full.md**:
- Large (15-25KB)
- Complete protocols
- Examples and edge cases
- **Use when needed**

### Constitutional Principles = Quality

Every agent enforces:
- ✅ Accuracy (zero fabrication)
- ✅ Tier-1/2 sources (>60% government/standards)
- ✅ Link verification (no bust links)
- ✅ MLA citations
- ✅ Gap transparency

## 🔥 POWER USER TIPS

### Tip 1: Keep PROMPT.md Bookmarked
- Create shortcuts to frequently used PROMPT.md files
- Load them in seconds for daily tasks
- Only load Full.md when you hit edge cases

### Tip 2: Use Quick Mode First
- Perplexity Researcher has QUICK (3-5 min) and COMPREHENSIVE (15-30 min)
- Start with QUICK MODE
- Upgrade to COMPREHENSIVE only if needed
- Save 10-25 minutes per search

### Tip 3: Build Custom Agents
- Use Agent Creator to build exactly what you need
- All agents inherit constitutional principles automatically
- Expands system without breaking workflow

### Tip 4: Chain Tools Together
```
Workflow Example:
Perplexity (find sources)
  → Writer (generate content)
  → Validator (check quality)
  → Mapper (format citations)
```

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

### ❌ Loading Full.md for Simple Tasks
**Problem**: Wastes 90 seconds loading 24KB when you just need one command
**Solution**: Use PROMPT.md for daily tasks, Full.md only for complex work

### ❌ Not Verifying Links
**Problem**: Wasting time on bust links and homepages
**Solution**: Perplexity Researcher verifies all links automatically (100% guarantee)

### ❌ Using Low-Quality Sources
**Problem**: Forums, blogs, Reddit in research
**Solution**: System enforces Tier-1/2 (government, standards, OEM only)

### ❌ Skipping Constitutional Checks
**Problem**: Fabricated data, unverified claims
**Solution**: All agents have built-in self-critique protocols
