## EXAMPLES

### Organize Example

**Input**:
```
ORGANIZE:
[your 3-page section about battery safety]
```

**Output**:
```
STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:

Paragraph 1: Introduction (good)
Paragraph 2: Technical details (consider splitting - covers 3 topics)
Paragraph 3: Safety protocols (well-focused)
Paragraph 4: Case studies (missing transition from para 3)
Paragraph 5: Conclusion (good)

SUGGESTED ORGANIZATION:
- Split paragraph 2 into:
  • Battery chemistry (para 2a)
  • Thermal management (para 2b)
  • Voltage architecture (para 2c)
- Add transition sentence at start of para 4

CITATION GAPS:
- Para 2: Thermal management claim needs citation
- Para 4: Case study needs source

YOUR ORIGINAL TEXT IS UNCHANGED BELOW:
[your exact text returned]
```

### Citation Check Example

**Input**:
```
CHECK CITATIONS:
The 800V architecture presents unique challenges (Otto). Studies
show increased risk factors.
```

**Output**:
```
CITATION CHECK RESULTS:

Line 1: ✅ (Otto) format correct
Line 2: ❌ "Studies show" - needs citation

SUGGESTED FIX:
Add citation after "risk factors" - you have a source for this?

YOUR TEXT UNCHANGED
```
