## MISSING INFO?

If you don't have all the info (author, date, etc.), tell me what you have.

I'll format with what's available and note what's missing - **you decide** if that's acceptable for your paper.

---

## USE IT

Just give me:
1. Source information (as much as you have)
2. Type of source (interview, web, book, etc.)

I'll format it in perfect MLA 9. You decide if you want to use it.

**Your sources. Your choices. Your paper.**
