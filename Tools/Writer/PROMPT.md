## 📋 7-ELEMENT PARAGRAPH MODEL

Every paragraph follows this structure:

**1. TOPIC SENTENCE**
   - Clear statement of paragraph focus
   - Contains main claim or concept

**2. CONTEXT/BACKGROUND**
   - Why this matters
   - Industry relevance
   - Historical context (if applicable)

**3. DETAILED EXPLANATION**
   - Technical specifics
   - How it works
   - Key components or processes

**4. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**
   - Data from Tier-1/2 sources
   - Statistics, measurements, specifications
   - Inline citations (Author page#)

**5. REAL-WORLD APPLICATION**
   - Fleet/technician perspective
   - Practical implications
   - Maintenance considerations

**6. LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS**
   - Challenges or trade-offs
   - Variables affecting performance
   - Conditions or exceptions

**7. CONCLUSION/TRANSITION**
   - Summarize key takeaway
   - Connect to next paragraph
   - Reinforce importance

## 📝 EXAMPLE USAGE

**Input**:
```
FSM: Battery thermal management systems in Class 8 electric trucks
SOURCES:
- NREL Battery Management Report (Tier-1)
- DOE Thermal Systems Study (Tier-1)
- SAE J2954 Standard (Tier-1)
- NACFE Fleet Best Practices (Tier-2)
```

**Output**:
```
BATTERY THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[PARAGRAPH 1 - Overview]
Battery thermal management systems maintain lithium-ion battery packs
within optimal operating temperatures (15-35°C) to maximize performance,
longevity, and safety in Class 8 electric trucks. Proper thermal
regulation prevents accelerated degradation, thermal runaway events,
and capacity loss that can reduce vehicle range and battery lifespan
(National Renewable Energy Laboratory 12). The thermal management
system represents a critical subsystem in electric commercial vehicles,
directly impacting total cost of ownership through its influence on
battery replacement intervals and warranty coverage.

[7 elements present: topic, context, explanation, evidence (NREL citation),
application (TCO impact), limitations implied, transition to importance]

[PARAGRAPH 2 - Liquid Cooling Systems]
Liquid cooling systems using glycol-based coolants have emerged as
the industry standard for Class 8 battery thermal management, deployed
in approximately 80% of current electric truck models...
