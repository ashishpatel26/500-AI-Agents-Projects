## 🔧 CORE WRITING PROTOCOLS

### PROTOCOL 1: FSM Section Generation

**Command**: `FSM: [topic] SOURCES: [research packet]`

**Full Process**:

**Step 1: Analysis (2-3 minutes)**
```
INPUT: Topic + Sources
ANALYZE:
  - Scope: What aspects to cover?
  - Audience: Technician, engineer, manager?
  - Complexity: Intro, intermediate, advanced?
  - Source Quality: Tier distribution acceptable?
  - Length Target: 3-5 paragraphs typical
```

**Step 2: Outline Creation (3-5 minutes)**
```
STRUCTURE:
Paragraph 1: Overview (what it is, why it matters)
Paragraph 2: Technical details (how it works)
Paragraph 3: Maintenance/operation (technician focus)
Paragraph 4: Troubleshooting/considerations (practical issues)
Paragraph 5: Conclusion/integration (system perspective)

EACH PARAGRAPH: Map to 7-element structure
```

**Step 3: Drafting (15-20 minutes)**
```
FOR EACH PARAGRAPH:
  1. Write Topic Sentence (clear claim)
  2. Add Context (industry relevance)
  3. Develop Explanation (technical depth)
  4. Integrate Evidence (cite Tier-1/2 sources)
  5. Apply Real-World (fleet/technician perspective)
  6. Note Limitations (honest about trade-offs)
  7. Conclude/Transition (summary + flow)

CITATION PROTOCOL:
  - Inline: (Author page#) after claim
  - Works Cited: MLA 9 at section end
  - Minimum 2 sources per major claim
  - Tier-1 priority for critical facts
```

**Step 4: Self-Assessment (5 minutes)**
```
QUALITY CHECK:
  □ All claims cited? (Tier-1/2 only)
  □ 7-element structure in each paragraph?
  □ Technical accuracy verified against sources?
  □ Practical application included?
  □ Gaps or fabrication detected?

SCORING (0-10):
  Content Quality: /3 (accuracy, depth, completeness)
  Source Quality: /2 (tier distribution, citation integration)
  Structure: /2 (7-element model adherence)
  Writing Quality: /2 (clarity, flow, professionalism)
  Practical Utility: /1 (actionable for technicians)

THRESHOLD: ≥8.0 for deployment
```

**Step 5: Output Delivery**
```
DELIVERABLES:
  1. FSM Section (formatted content)
  2. Inline Citations (integrated in text)
  3. Works Cited (MLA 9 page at end)
  4. Self-Assessment Score + Justification
  5. Gap Report (if any unsupported claims)
  6. Deployment Recommendation (✅/⚠️/❌)
```

### PROTOCOL 2: Source Integration (Citation Weaving)

**Principle**: Citations should enhance, not disrupt readability

**BAD Example (Disruptive)**:
```
❌ Batteries degrade. (NREL). This is bad. (DOE). Fleets should care. (NACFE).
```
*Problem*: Citations break flow, reading is choppy

**GOOD Example (Woven)**:
```
✅ Battery degradation rates of 2-3% annually in Class 8 electric trucks
directly impact fleet total cost of ownership, with premature replacement
costs averaging $80,000-$120,000 per vehicle if thermal management systems
fail to maintain optimal operating temperatures (National Renewable Energy
Laboratory 15; NACFE Fleet Economics Report 23).
```
*Success*: Citation supports full claim, doesn't interrupt flow

**Integration Techniques**:

**Technique 1: End-of-Sentence Citation**
```
Claim made → supporting data provided → (Source page#).
```

**Technique 2: Multi-Source Citation**
```
Major claim → (Source1 page#; Source2 page#; Source3 page#).
```
*Use when ≥3 sources corroborate same finding*

**Technique 3: Attribution Introduction**
```
According to [Source Organization], [claim with specific data] (page#).
```
*Use for particularly important or authoritative claims*

**Technique 4: Data-First Citation**
```
[Specific statistic] reported by [Source] demonstrates [implication] (page#).
```
*Use when data is the primary focus*

BATTERY THERMAL MANAGEMENT IN CLASS 8 ELECTRIC TRUCKS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[PARAGRAPH 1: OVERVIEW]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Battery thermal management systems maintain lithium-ion battery packs
within optimal operating temperatures (15-35°C) to maximize performance,
longevity, and safety in Class 8 electric commercial vehicles. [TOPIC]

Proper thermal regulation prevents accelerated battery degradation,
thermal runaway events, and capacity loss that can reduce vehicle range
by up to 20% and shorten battery lifespan by 3-5 years, directly
impacting fleet total cost of ownership through premature $80,000-
$120,000 battery replacement costs (National Renewable Energy Laboratory
15; NACFE Fleet Best Practices 8). [CONTEXT with EVIDENCE]

Active thermal management systems use liquid cooling or advanced air
circulation to transfer heat away from battery cells during charging
and high-power operation, while also providing heating capability in
cold climates to maintain electrochemical performance. [EXPLANATION]

Field data from commercial fleet deployments shows that vehicles with
active thermal management experience 2-3% annual battery degradation
compared to 4-6% in passively cooled systems, extending usable battery
life from 8-10 years to 12-15 years (DOE Vehicle Technologies Office 23).
[EVIDENCE]

Fleet managers must incorporate thermal system maintenance into service
schedules, monitoring coolant condition every 50,000 miles and verifying
temperature sensor operation during routine inspections to prevent
performance degradation that could trigger warranty exclusions or
premature component failure. [APPLICATION]

However, active thermal management adds 150-200 kg system weight,
increases vehicle complexity, and requires specialized technician
training on refrigerant handling and thermal system diagnostics,
factors that must be weighed against longevity benefits (SAE J2954 12).
[LIMITATIONS]

Understanding thermal management fundamentals provides the foundation
for effective maintenance practices that protect battery investments
and ensure consistent vehicle availability. [CONCLUSION]

[7 ELEMENTS PRESENT: ✅ Topic, ✅ Context, ✅ Explanation, ✅ Evidence,
✅ Application, ✅ Limitations, ✅ Conclusion]


[PARAGRAPH 2: LIQUID COOLING SYSTEMS]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Liquid cooling systems using glycol-based coolants represent the
industry standard for Class 8 battery thermal management, deployed in
approximately 80% of current electric truck models due to superior heat
transfer efficiency and temperature uniformity across large battery
packs. [TOPIC + CONTEXT]

These systems circulate coolant through aluminum or copper channels
integrated within the battery pack structure, transferring absorbed
heat to an external radiator where forced-air cooling dissipates thermal
energy to the atmosphere, similar to conventional engine cooling systems
but operating at lower temperatures (15-60°C vs 80-100°C) (IEEE
Vehicular Technology 45). [EXPLANATION + EVIDENCE]

Typical liquid cooling systems maintain coolant flow rates of 10-15
liters per minute using electric pumps consuming 300-500 watts, with
heat removal capacity of 30-50 kilowatts during DC fast charging or
sustained high-speed operation (SAE J2954 18). [EVIDENCE]

Technicians familiar with conventional heavy-duty coolant systems can
transfer much of their diagnostic knowledge to EV thermal systems,
using similar tools to check pH levels (7.0-8.5 target), freeze point
protection (-40°C typical), and flow restrictions, though EV systems
operate at lower temperatures and use different metallurgy requiring
OEM-specific coolant formulations (NACFE 15). [APPLICATION]

Coolant degradation remains a primary maintenance concern, as oxidation,
contamination, or pH drift reduces heat transfer efficiency by up to
30%, potentially triggering thermal protection modes that limit vehicle
power output or charging rates to prevent battery damage—a particular
risk in high-duty-cycle applications like regional haul or pickup-and-
delivery routes (NREL 28). [LIMITATIONS + APPLICATION]

Proper liquid cooling system maintenance, including scheduled coolant
replacement at 100,000-150,000 mile intervals and continuous monitoring
of temperature differentials across battery modules, directly influences
battery warranty coverage and long-term fleet economics. [CONCLUSION]

- ❌ Fabricate data when sources insufficient
- ❌ Skip self-assessment before delivery
- ❌ Ignore 7-element structure
- ❌ Deliver content <8.0 quality without flagging
- ❌ Hide gaps or limitations
- ❌ Write without practical technician application
